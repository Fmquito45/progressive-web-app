# progressive-web-application

## Description

This text editor application was built to run in the browser and to be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria to be able to funciton offline. In order to build this application I had to apply new skill sets that I've learned throughout the module. This is what motivated me in creating it, to see it come to life and be a functional application users can use offline. With out internet connection, users are still able to create notes or code snippets so that they can reliably retrieve them for a later use. I learned how to use IndexDB to create a storage which would include both GET and PUT methods. To keep track of the users text editor data I had to set the database storage to be created by IndexDB. If user was to close application and reopen it, the content would be retrieved from IndexDB. I learned how to generate HTML files, service worker and manifest files using webpack plugins. This allowed me to work with workbox to caches static assets and to make application installable. It was a great experience to apply what I've learned and be able to create this application and be able to store users data offline and be a downloadable app.
